        <p>Hey! A lot of people call me Shelby but you can call me anytime ;). My degree is horticulture with a cluster 
        in event planning but since this is only my first year I'm still trying to figure out exactly what I want 
        to study. Some of my hobbies include hiking, listening to music, taking naps, cooking, and watching movies.
        I really enjoy the videography and photography as well. </p>
        <p>So like I mentioned, I'm studing horticulture which I'm actually really excited for. I really love being 
            in nature and seeing diffrent types of plants. I'm hoping I'm able to do something like landscape design
        or really anything in the floral industry. The thing I love most about byui is probably the enviorment. It's 
    intresting being in a place where most people are members of the church. I grew up in southern cailfornia so I
never really experienced something like that. It is my first year though so my feelings might change haha.  </p>
        <p>I mostly took this course to learn a new skill. I would like to know how to do coding and I think this 
            is a great beginner course for that. I guess I'll end things by telling you my favorite scripture which is 
            D&C 97:8. Anyways thanks for reading my rant, can't wait to get to know all of you guys!</p>
